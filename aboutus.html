                <p>
                    Created in 2018 in the borough of Bj√∏lsen, Oslo by students at the OsloMet university, InCont is an experience first, travel agency second.
                    The customers is what our company is created for, and we take great pride in being so cheap that our competitors go bankrupt.
                    We also use norwegian native airline, Norwegian, because we belive that the airline is a key figure to keeping travel cheap in Norway.
                    Our support of Norwegian is also to help make sure that in country travel in Norway is no monopolized, like some are trying really hard to do right now.
